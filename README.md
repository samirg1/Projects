# Wordle

breakdown of files

- answers.py
  - list of all valid wordle answers in alphabetical order

- guesses.py
  - list of all valid wordle guesses in alphabetical order

- first_guess.txt
  - sorted list of guesses generated by solver.py respective to the amount of possible answers on average left after using the guess
  - the best word found was trace, this is used in solver.py as the first guess

- gui.py
  - a fully function gui for wordle that uses tkinter to display the game
  - keyboard button on the interface can be used but the keyboard is also binded
  - stats are stored on each 'run', with no double ups of answers occuring in a 'run'

- solver.py
  - a solver for wordle that has two modes:
    - user:
      - to get user mode make sure the mode at the top of the file reads 'USER'
      - the user mode prints the first guess solved for and presented in first_guess.txt and gets user input to determine the outcome
      - it then calculates the next best guess (during the calculation stage the status of the calculation is printed)
      - the format of the outcome is as follows: a string of length 5, with a '-' for a blank, 'o' for an orange square and 'g' for a green square in the correct order
    - bot:
      - to get bot mode change the mode at the top of the file to 'BOT' and specify the amount of words to guess
      - the bot mode requires one or two additional parameters to the creation of the game object
      - the bot will then create its own word to guess and solve it using the same methodology as default mode (outcome is instead generated itself)
      - as in the default mode the progress of this process is printed out to the terminal
      - once the bot has guessed n words, it will print a summary of the words it has guessed, this includes: amount of words guessed, average amount of attempts needed, if there was any errors and the total time it took
  
  - this file also contains the function used to create the first_guess.txt file

any comments or feedback on code, programming practices, algorithm choices etc. is welcomed.
