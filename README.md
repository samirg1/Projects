# Wordle

breakdown of files

- answers.py
  - list of all valid wordle answers in alphabetical order

- guesses.py
  - list of all valid wordle guesses in alphabetical order

- first_guess.txt
  - sorted list of guesses generated by solver.py respective to the amount of possible answers on average left after using the guess
  - the best word found was trace, this is used in solver.py as the first guess

- gui.py
  - a fully function gui for wordle that uses tkinter to display the game
  - keyboard button on the interface can be used but the keyboard is also binded
  - stats are stored on each 'run', with no double ups of answers occuring in a 'run'

- solver.py
  - a solver for wordle that has two modes:
    - user:
      - to get user mode enter 'USER' when prompted in the terminal
      - the user mode prints the first guess (solved for and presented in first_guess.txt) and gets user to input the outcome
      - the format of the inputted outcome is as follows: a string of length 5, with a '-' for a blank, 'o' for an orange square and 'g' for a green square, all in the correct order
      - it then calculates the next best guess (during the calculation stage the status of the calculation is printed) and the next outcome is asked for
      - this continues until there is only one answer left, in which case the game will print the answer and end code execution
    - bot:
      - to get bot mode enter 'BOT' when prompted in the terminal
      - then enter an integer > 0 (that determines how many words the bot will try and solve) when prompted in the terminal
      - the bot will then create its own random word to solve, and solve it using the same methodology as user mode (outcome is instead generated itself rather than requiring user input)
      - as in the user mode the progress of this process is printed out to the terminal
      - once the bot has guessed all words, it will print a summary of the words it has guessed, this includes: amount of words guessed, average amount of attempts needed, if there was any errors and the total time it took
  
  - this file also contains the function used to create the first_guess.txt file

any comments, feedback or improvements on code, programming practices, algorithm choices etc. is more than welcomed and very much appreciated :)
